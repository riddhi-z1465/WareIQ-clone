              WareIQ has its partner network to deliver it to QC dark stores.
              Based on the size of the consignment, we can choose from B2C
              courier, small vehicle like TATA Ace, or Part-truck load movement.
              All partners are vetted and measured on their on-time delivery

            <p class="answer">
              Currently, Quick Commerce platforms do not have a seller panel and
              don’t have ready APIs. So, the Purchase orders need to be manually
              uploaded on the WareIQ platform. This will change as APIs from the
              platforms go live.
